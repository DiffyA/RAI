Project for the Information Access and Retrieval class, given at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.

The goal of this assignment is to host a website online, and to rank as highly as possible in Google's search results when providing it with specific search queries. This can be done by following SEO practices and principles, and this repository will be used to keep track of the progress and all files used for the project.

The search queries that will be tested against will be:
  1. "recuperacion y acceso a la informacion"
  2. "recuperacion acceso informacion crowdsourcing"

The website content will be in Spanish, as required by class guidelines, but documentation and code will be in English.

The website which this project intends to rank within Google is www.informacion-crowdsourcing.com
